Home Self Care API
==================
This is the standard API for Self Care functions related to TV, Internet, Voice and all other Home services for Tigo including TigoSTAR and UNE. 
We use swagger-2.0 specification
    
What is a ContractId? This is a unique identifier for a relation between our company and our customer.
Some customers may have more than one Contract, for example they can have one contract for their vacation home at the beach,
and other contract for their everyday home. Most resourcers require a ContractId value on the path.
Many methods have a counterpart method that use a compound key using a document type and a document number. 
Those methods that are queried by doc-type and customerId (the document number) will return data
from several contracts.

Additionally, one contract may have different products associated. For example "Internet", "TV", "Telefonï¿½a Fija".
Each Product will have a base offering and additional offerings that are part of the product. for example the base offering can be "Basic Plan TV" and a second offering can be "HBO".
Each offering may have a list of devices associated, typically only the main offer has devices.

The Product Hierarchy is like this <br>
ProductList -> Product -> OfferingList -> Offering -> DeviceList -> Device
