App Callback Payment Gateway
============================
This is the specification that, any App integrating payment gateway functionalities, must implement in order to receive call backs for two events.
<ul>
<li>Processing Completed</li>
<li>Fulfillment Completed</li>
</ul>

This callbacks will enable asynchronous processing of the payment, so the App does not need to keep polling for the result. Although APIs to poll the result will be provided too.
It is expected that the App host these callbacks in their App Servers supporting HTTPS.

The base path expressed here is relative to the App Server URL. Meaning that if for example the App Server handle all API calls in this URL:

`https://micuenta.tigo.com.sv/api/`

the base path expresed here will be added at the end that URL. This will be the suggested base path:

`/v1/paymentgateway/callbacks/`

So the combined base path for the example will be

`https://micuenta.tigo.com.sv/api/v1/paymentgateway/callbacks/`

This solution is to be used in all countries, since it is assumed each country host each App Server in a different URL, the country will be simply part of the callback URL and we don't need a parameter for that.

Apps like "Mi Tigo", also known as "Mi Cuenta" may need to have different types of payments within the same App. 
For example they may need to offer invoice payment for mobile phone, invoice payments for the home business, core balance top-up for hybrid-accounts and even directly selling some on demand content.
Each one of this product types have:
  * Different fulfillment APIs in the countrie's billing system
  * Different rules for minimum amount, maximum amount and velocity
  * May even have different payment methods available, some may be too expensive for a $1 topup
  * Different fraud prevention rules like for example the acceptance of international credit cards

For these reasons, each different product type will have its own App entity in the Payment Gateway and so, will have its own set of callback URL for both payemnt and fulfillment, 
so any information about the business unit and product can be part of the url as a fixed hierarchy. For example:

* `/v1/paymentgateway/callbacks/home/invoices`
* `/v1/paymentgateway/callbacks/mobile/topups`
* `/v1/paymentgateway/callbacks/convergent/invoices`

And finally all callbacks will receive the Order Id as part of the callback URL, plus the type of callback as the resource being modified.
So notify about payment information of an order this will be method used:

`/orders/{purchaseOrderId}/payment`

And to notify about fulfillment information of an order this will be the method used:

`/orders/{purchaseOrderId}/fulfillment`

Here are two example of full callback URLs.

Sample URL to notify the App Server that a payment was processed. The App may consider this the final step and notify the user that the payment was approved. And trust the Payment Gateway to complete the fulfillment on the billing systems asyncrhonously.

`https://micuenta.tigo.com.sv/api/v1/paymentgateway/callbacks/home/invoices/orders/{purchaseOrderId}/payment`

Sample URL to notify the App Server that the fulfillment was completed. In a topup scenario, the fulfillment is more important than the payment, because if the payment is approved but the topup cannot be completed because the number was invalid or any other reason, the user needs to know as soon as possible that the transaction was not completed (and payment was rollbacked).

### Security
---
**backend_auth**  

|apiKey|*API Key*|
|---|---|
|Description|This is the security that must be implemented by the countries, in addition to any authentication mechanism they have, this additional security serves to sign the message. Since the message is signed, the App Server can be sure the payment is real and that it was not forged by any other party, for example, a developer with access to the callback API.  Another benefit of the Token is that the token can be passed through proxies without the need for those proxies to know the signing details and password.  Use of JWT standard was discarded since JWT allows for for the caller to set the hash algorithm to 'None', effectively bypassing the security. For that reason we are going to force the algorithm to HMAC with SHA-256 using a pre-shared key.  The payload to be signed will include the following values (Note: paymentRegistrationId is only included in the Fulfillment callback):  'productType' + 'IdType' + 'id' +  'purchaseOrderId' + 'paymentCurrencyId' + 'paymentAmount' +  'paymentApproved' + 'paymentGatewayTransactionId' +  'RegistrationDate' + 'paymentRegistrationId' + '[pre-shared secret]' |
